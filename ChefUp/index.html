In addition to checking the temperature, you can also cut into the meat and see its level of doneness—medium-rare meat will be pink at the center but not raw. We always recommend making sure that your pan is nice and hot before adding the meat so you get that perfect sear. For timing, think 5 minutes for medium rare, and longer if you like it more well done.</p>
